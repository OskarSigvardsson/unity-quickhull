* Quickhull for Unity
This repository contains an implementation of the Quickhull algorithm for
generating 3d convex hulls from point clouds, written for Unity. A convex hull
is the smallest convex shape that contains a given set of points (basically: if
you have a bunch of points in space, the convex hull is what you'd get if you
"shrinkwrapped" as tightly as possible). 

The code should be pretty stable, and 

** Demo
Convex hulls are useful in a variety of algorithms in graphics and gamedev. The
simplest of which is maybe as a low-poly "rock generator", which is included in
the project.

The way this works is pretty simple: just generate a bunch of random points, use
the ConvexHullCalculator to calculate convex hulls for them which is used to
create meshes. 

** Usage
The only file that really matters is ConvexHullCalculator.cs in the Scripts
folder. You can either just copy that file into your project, or add the
repository into a Plugins folder. 

ConvexHullCalculator.cs defines a class called ConvexHullCalculator that can
calculate 3d convex hulls from a point cloud containing at least 4 points. It
returns lists of vertices, triangles and normals that can be directly converted
into a mesh (see example for how to do this).

If there are less than 4 points, or if all points are coplanar, the calculator
will throw an exception, as 3d convex hulls aren't really defined in those
cases.

The class uses a number of internal buffers for doing the calculation, but they
are all reused for subsequent calculations in order to avoid generating garbage.
You can see in the example that the same ConvexHullCalculator (as well as the
List<T>'s used to store the results) can be reused many times so you can avoid
generating garbage. 

The calculator itself doesn't interact at all with the Unity engine, so it's
perfectly safe to run the calculations on background threads. However, the
calculator is not thread-safe, so a single calculator cannot be used at the same
time by two or more threads. If you wish to run multiple calculations in
parallel, use one calculator per thread.
